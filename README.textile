Other versions of these requirements may work, but have not been tested.

Inside the eboshi directory, install gems using Bundler:

bc. bundle install

h3. Configure & Finish

Copy config/database.sample.yml to config/database.yml, then edit it to match your database configuration.

Run @bundle exec rake eboshi:bootstrap@ to create and set up the database.

Run the application to finish the installation:

Start the server with passenger, thin, webrick, whatever, and load it up in your browser. You will then be led through the rest of the installation (e.g. creating an admin account, etc.)
